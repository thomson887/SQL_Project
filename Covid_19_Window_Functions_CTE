-- Window functions using CTE
-- To find the country with the highest daily deaths.
-- Using Row_number is ok if you are interested in obtaining only the country with the highest daily_deaths. Using ROW_NUMBER will only give you the first entry for each date irrespective of the country which have the same deaths on that particular date. If you want all --- countries with the same daily_death to appear in the output then you should use RANK() function
-- If the output of the SQL code is to be used for further analysis then you may have to use RANK or DENSE_RANK depending upon how you want the data to be ranked.
